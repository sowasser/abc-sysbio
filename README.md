# abc-sysbio

A fork of ABC-SysBio, version 2.08, a package for Approximate Bayesian Computation in Python.

From [the developers][develop]: "abc-sysbio implements likelihood free parameter inference and model selection in dynamical systems. It is designed to work with both stochastic and deterministic models written in python or Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). abc-sysbio combines three algorithms: ABC rejection sampler, ABC SMC for parameter inference and ABC SMC for model selection."
